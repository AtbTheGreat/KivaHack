Hi Anna,

We got tired and went home to sleep. We will be back by 1 at the latest, but possibly earlier.

In the meantime you could:
-do any of the codecademy.com API tutorials
-do the meteor.com tutorial
-figure out how to draw a graphic using data from the kiva API and open source chart drawing code (Google charts is one option we discussed)
